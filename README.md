# App Idea: Population Data Approval & Management System

Your app will focus on data approval and acceptance functionalities, ensuring that population-related data goes through a verification process before being stored and used.

🚀 Core Features & Workflow
1️⃣ User Roles & Permissions
To manage the approval process efficiently, define three roles:
✅ Data Entry User – Adds new population data (e.g., Census Officer, Data Collector)
✅ Approver – Reviews and approves/rejects data (e.g., Supervisor, Analyst)
✅ Admin – Manages users, controls settings, and has full access

📌 Example: A Data Entry User submits the Total Population for a region. The Approver must review and approve it before it is added to the database.

2️⃣ Data Submission & Approval Process
✅ Step 1: Data Entry

Users can input data manually or import CSV/Excel files
Data is stored in a "Pending Approval" table
✅ Step 2: Data Review

Approvers see all submitted data in a dashboard
They can view details, compare historical data, and flag inconsistencies
✅ Step 3: Approve or Reject

Approvers can:
🔹 Approve → Data moves to the official dataset
🔹 Reject → Data is returned for corrections with comments
✅ Step 4: Version Control & Logs

Maintain versions of approved data
Keep a log of who approved/rejected what and why
📌 Example: A new birth rate entry is submitted. The Approver checks it against past data and approves it.
